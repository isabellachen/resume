        <h1>Hi! I'm Isabella.</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer, and I work with
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Three years ago, I taught myself how to
          code. Since then, I've developed production ready apps and websites,
          working on many projects with a wide variety of technologies.
          Front-end technologies I have enjoyed working with are React + Redux
          and GatsbyJS, Vue and NuxtJS. I've also enjoyed customising content
          management systems like Strapi and Wordpress, and have experience with
          coding plugins. I've also

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <h3>Plain Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Sept 2018 - present</em> \ Software Engineer working in a Full Stack
      role on a wide variety of consultancy projects. I've worked on marketing
      websites, pixel perfect Microsoft demos, enterprise tools, and even a
      hinting engine for web best practices.
    </p>
    <h3>Codeworks</h3>
    <p>
      <em>January 2018 - September 2018</em> \ Software Engineer and JavaScript
      Teaching Assistant. I developed internal tools used in the evaluation of
      student performance and the handing out of assignments and notes. I worked
      with Express, Firebase and Heroku. Earlier iterations of the project were
      in mySQL.
    </p>
    <h3>The World Bank</h3>
    <p>
      <em>April 2018 - June 2018</em> Consultancy work for the World Bank
      working on a proof of concept for data collection through Facebook
      Messenger. The idea was to use Typeform's form system to make it easy for
      workers in developing countries to create their own chatbot on Facebook.
      NodeJS was used as middle-end architecture between the forms and
      Facebook's API.
    </p>
    <h3>She Says Singapore</h3>
    <p>
      <em>July 2018 - August 2018</em> Website developer for She Says Singapore
      with React/Gatsby, GraphQL and Styled Components. This project led to
      working on a node plugin to pull data from Eventbrite and transform them
      so Gatsby's GraphQL architecture could consume it.

      Webhint is a linting tool that's meant to help website owners and
      developers with their site's accessibility, speed, security and more. On
      this project, I worked on an algorithm to check if a website was using
      unsupported CSS. Unit testing with Ava.

      A proof of concept for the World Bank to use Typeform and Facebook
      Messenger to give non-developers the power to create their own bots. The
      project was a NodeJS server that served as a middle-end between Typeform's
      API and Facebook's API. Unit testing with Jest.

      A Chrome extension that lets users save urls to markers on a personal
      instance of Google Maps. While planning for road trips, I often save
      bookmarks to many websites which I then reference later. However, it's
      difficult to know the locations the websites refer to. This Chrome
      extension helps users locate the places that the websites refer to on a
      map.

      This is my travel website which I&#39;ve had for quite some years now and
      has 5000+ hits a month. Through the years I&#39;ve customised a number of
      themes and troubleshooted buggy plugins. I&#39;m no means a Wordpress
      guru, but I can build a nice Wordpress site with strong SEO for
      non-developers that&#39;s easy to maintain.
