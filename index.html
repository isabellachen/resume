        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer, and I work with
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I've been developing apps and websites
          for three years, and I've worked on many projects with a wide variety
          of technologies. Most of my earliest projects are NodeJS projects,
          with MongoDB. I've also developed a couple of Facebook apps, and even
          a library to

            >convert a Typeform into a conversation on Facebook Messenger</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm interested in working in a fast paced environment with a tech
          stack I want to work with, and plenty of interesting challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've developed many <strong>production ready apps</strong> in a wide
          variety of technologies.

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <h3>Plain Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Sept 2018 - present</em> \ Software Engineer working in a Full Stack
      role on a wide variety of consultancy projects. I've worked on marketing
      websites, pixel perfect Microsoft demos, enterprise tools, and even a
      hinting engine for web best practices.
    </p>
    <h3>Codeworks</h3>
    <p>
      <em>January 2018 - September 2018</em> \ Software Engineer and JavaScript
      Teaching Assistant. I developed internal tools used in the evaluation of
      student performance and the handing out of assignments and notes. I worked
      with Express, Firebase and Heroku. Earlier iterations of the project were
      in mySQL.
    </p>
    <h3>The World Bank</h3>
    <p>
      <em>April 2018 - June 2018</em> Consultancy work for the World Bank
      working on a proof of concept for data collection through Facebook
      Messenger. The idea was to use Typeform's form system to make it easy for
      workers in developing countries to create their own chatbot on Facebook.
      NodeJS was used as middle-end architecture between the forms and
      Facebook's API.
    </p>
    <h3>She Says Singapore</h3>
    <p>
      <em>July 2018 - August 2018</em> Website developer for She Says Singapore
      with React/Gatsby, GraphQL and Styled Components. This project led to
      working on a node plugin to pull data from Eventful and transform them so
      Gatsby's GraphQL architecture could consume it.

    <p>
      Webhint is a linting tool that's meant to help website owners and
      developers with their site's accessibility, speed, security and more. On
      this project, I worked on an algorithm to check if a website was using
      unsupported CSS. Unit testing with Ava.

      A proof of concept for the World Bank to use Typeform and Facebook
      Messenger to give non-developers the power to create their own bots. The
      project was a NodeJS server that served as a middle-end between Typeform's
      API and Facebook's API. Unit testing with Jest.

      A Chrome extension that lets users save urls to markers on a personal
      instance of Google Maps. While planning for road trips, I often save
      bookmarks to many websites which I then reference later. However, it's
      difficult to know the locations the websites refer to. This Chrome
      extension helps users locate the places that the websites refer to on a
      map.
